There have several parts of scripts.


1. alignment parts: you must have some genomes which may have a large of numbers. It should be nucleotide? the protein parts would implement later.
2. Order part: you must pass a tree to the file which decide the order of these genomes. This script doesn't build the tree for you.  But you could also disable the tree visuliazation. And use some user-defined order or something else.
3. Annotation parts: you must pass some protein id or information to this script or use some kegg annotation tables.
